Stations
    There are 4 stations -> Apollo 12, Apollo 14, Apollo 15, Apollo 16; all of which are situated on the Near side of Earth's Moon. 
    There was also Apollo 11, which operated for only 21 days, data from Apollo 11 sometimes appears as if it was 12.
    Another experiment was the LSPE, which was done on station 17 sometimes appears here too.
-------------------------------------------------------
Deep Moonquakes (DM) -> These are areas, not events
    Locations: 
            A: Identifier (there are some left here, that are present in "arrivals")
            Side: N/F (Nearest/Furthest)
            Latitude, Longitude, Depth: Coordinates, they have "error" columns if we want to specyfy that or take that in count for the animation
    Arrivals: 
            A: Identifier
            12,14,15,16 P: P Waves data for each station (P waves are faster and go first, they travel through solid and liqud)
            12,14,15,16 S: S Waves data for each station (S waves are weaker and go after, can't travel through liquid)


Shallow Moonquakes (SM) -> 
    Locations: 
            Time: YYYY JJJ HH mm SS
            Latitude, Longitude
            Magnitude

    Arrivals: One row for each station that perceived the moonquake, time is displayed once
            Time: YYYY JJJ HHHH
            Data for S Waves: 4 columns I dont understand yet and one for mean
            Data for P Waves: 4 columns I dont understand yet and one for mean

Meteoroids (M) -> Same format as Shallow Moonquakes, has no location .csv
    Locations: 

    Arrivals: 
            Time: YYYY JJJ HHHHH
            Data for S Waves: 4 columns I dont understand yet and one for mean
            Data for P Waves: 4 columns I dont understand yet and one for mean

Artificial Impact (AI) -> 
    Locations: 
            Time: YY JJJ HH mm .ss
            Latitude, Longitude
            Identifier

    Arrivals: 
            12, 14, 15, 16, 17: there's one row for every one of those numbers, and it's combination with T, D, S.
            I don't understand it yet

-------------------------------------------------------
Final .csv's
    We have to specify where we got our data and what does it represent
    Every event (not including DM) has:
            Time: YYYY JJJ HH mm ss(optional)
                Starting time *** Provides main order
                (Opt) ending time
            Location:
                Latitude (spherical)
                Longitude (spherical)
            ID: Ordinal + Event Type
            Name: If event has a specified name (like meteorites or artificial impacts), then that's the name, else, name's equal to ID
            Magnitude: Only for SM (¿Can we approximate magnitude from P and S?)
            Stations Data: For each one we can manage to give S-Mean and P-Mean data
                12
                14
                15
                16
                17 (Only for AI)
-------------------------------------------------------
    For DMs, we'll have a separate .csv that'll show DM Areas:
        Location:
            Latitude (spherical)
            Longitude (spherical)
            Depth (km)
            X Error -> For each previous column we have an error one (same units), we can use that for providing radious to the point
            Side F/N (Furthest and Nearest to Earth)
        Mean P and S waves ¿magnitude? for each station:
            12
            14
            15
            16
        ID (ORDINAL FROM ORIGINAL CSV)
    *** We'll have some of them with no location, and some IDs will be left (for example, 45-48 are skipped in the ordinal ID sequence)
-------------------------------------------------------
lognonne CSV: 
    changes made
        To M 1976-Nov-14 (day was shown as 4, while other catalogues showed it as 14, every other field matched withother  catalogues)
        A26 DM is  deprecated since there is a character leest on date format, and we weren't able to find any other DM clustered data available to check date failures
        To M 1977-Apr-17 day was changed, since it was shown as 1977-04-71, all other catalogues showed it as 1977-04-17 (reason why whole event was not deprecated)
    Type -> 
        AI: Event Name
        Meteoroid: M
        Shallow Moonquake: SH
        Major Deep Moonquake: A + Int
    Lat -> Event Latitude 
    Long -> Event  Longitude
    Depth (km) -> Event Depth. Approximatedly:
        0 for M and AI
        < 100km for SH
        Betweeen 700 & 1000 km for DM
