A1-4            

P1-4            Availability of seismograms in expanded time scale:
                            1 = Calcomp incremental plotter plot
                            2 = Versatec matrix plotter plot
                Para las 4 estaciones (11 y 12 en una misma columna)

Q1-4            Data quality code (single column for each station):
                    1 = no data available for the station
                    2 = noisy data
                    3 = signal is masked by another, larger event
                    4 = compressed plot is clipped (original digital data
                        may not be clipped)
                    5 = see comments
                    6 = the time recorded with the data is computer-
                        generated, and thus is not exact

COMMENTS        Might be useful for annotations and clustering

T1-2            Event type:
                    A = classified (matching) deep moonquake
                    M = unclassified deep moonquake
                    C = meteoroid impact
                    H = shallow moonquake
                    Z = mostly short-period event
                    L = LM impact
                    S = S-IVB impact
                    X = special type
                Seems like:
                    1-2 match, except for M-A or null-A ;
                    second column has null only on null-null situations, and that has no M (al final si hay, pero menos) ;
                    2 is an update for 1

N1-2            Matching Deep Moonquake Class (a 0-? number, one for each T column)
